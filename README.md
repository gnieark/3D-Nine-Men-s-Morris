# 3D-Nine-Men-s-Morris
3D version of the game Nine Men's Morris

I designed a classic 2D version of this game. Published on thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:755742

2D game's rules are on wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Men%27s_Morris

Now lets work on 3D version.

## To do:
* Better design ( for exemple Staircases in place of verticals ways)
* Make it printable on a Reprap
